unFocus History Keeper is a [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) based deep linking and browser history (back button) management library for single page browser based applications, also called [RIAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application), and usually based on [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/) or [Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX), though this should work with other scriptable runtimes as well, such as [Microsoft's SilverLight](http://www.microsoft.com/SILVERLIGHT/) or [Sun's JavaFX](http://www.sun.com/software/javafx/).
